Repo for my nfl betting strategies

You can run get_play_history.py from the ReadingESPNWinProb folder by downloading the entire repo on windows and running the command:
python get_play_history.py

If you don't have windows, you have to install the right chromedriver in the folder and change the path in the get_play_history.py file

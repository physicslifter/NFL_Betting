This is a file for tracking progress

==================
To-do:
- troubleshoot problem with Raiders-Chargers game
- check single season to ensure that all games are scraped and saved
- set up script to read all data from all years
- scrape data for all years going back to the 2016 season
- build & finalize database in github repo
- add data to places (share)
- write code for reading in odds data
- write live script for win prob scraping
- write live script for odds data
- do latency assessments
- build a combined dataset

==================
Completed:
- Write python script that scrapes win probability data from ESPN.com games
- figure out how to get selenium chromedriver working again
- organize code in classes
- add a way to search for games without having to look up game id
- find each unique id that is associated with the class "Scoreboard bg-clr-white flex flex-auto jutify-between"
- find method that makes it easier to find games than by putting in their game id
- how to get the date for games that have taken place within the last week
- test whether the failure encountered in last week's cardinal's-Ram game was indeed because the game was last week. My hunch is that games from over a week ago have a data associated with them, whereas games from the past week do not
- troubleshoot data issues
- write looop for (get data, if fail, try again n times)
- write special handling case for teams w/ 2 letter abbreviations
- troubleshoot problem with Rams-Bills game
- fix date string formatting problem so that files save nicely
- write code for handling an overtime scenario
- troubleshoot failure problem with Cin-PIT week 1 game
- check single week to ensure that all games are scraped and saved
- write new function that works for checking whether the file is complete
- set up repository strictly for NFL win probability data


==================
Notes:
- need some search method. Something that works like:
    - enter a week & season, and all games from that week/season pop up
    - need to find all ids associated with the class name I wrote down

- season type doesnt make a difference w/ respect to whether there is win probability data in the gamecast
- win probability data begins for the 2016 season
- "end fail" is when it gwets some data, but quits before the end, and the last bit of the graph is a straight line
- datapoint fail is when there is a seemingly misaligned datapoint

- Atlanta favord: win probabilities r correct, NO favored, error occurs
- new hypothesis: error occurs from team name w 2 letters







BRB!
